# üåü Crumbs: Dynamic Trivia via Notifications üåü

## üìú Description

Crumbs utilizes LLMs to deliver periodic customizable trivia
facts to you. Whether you're a trivia enthusiast or just looking for a fun and
lightweight way to learn new things, Crumbs has got your back!

## üöÄ Features

- **Trivia Fact Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate trivia facts. You could use your own large language model as well, whether locally or from HuggingFace.
- **Smart Deduplication:** Employs TF-IDF and cosine similarity to avoid repetitive facts.
- **System Notifications:** Delivers facts directly to your Macbook's notifications.
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Operates within specified hours, suitable for daily routines.
- **Non-invasive:** Crumbs runs super quietly in the background and uses virtually no resources. You can monitor this by searching "python" in Activity Monitor. Look for the job number corresponding to this script via

```zshrc
$ jobs -l
[1]  + [No. here] running    nohup python breadcrumbs.py
```
